###Instructions###

preface: the Makefile has most of the repeatable functions within the repository.  Most of the instructions are calls to the makefile, but you can always inspect the Makefile for sequential shell commands.  Also - as of this writing, the ENS client is not complete - there are stubs in the unit tests.

The unit tests assume a recently built, running docker image as generated by the instructions below.

There aren't any special python libraries used, so stock python 2.7 should work.

How to build the docker image:

prerequisites:

* make sure the submodule has been downloaded and initialized by either typing _make init_ or typing _git submodule update --init_ within the repository.


How to build the docker image:

    make build

How to run the docker image with the flags that expose the port the unittests are looking for:

    make run

How to run the unit tests:

    make test
